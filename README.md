and follow these step:

for the backend :=

Set Up the Express App with TypeScript:

Install the necessary dependencies: bash: npm init -y npm install express body-parser cors npm install --save-dev typescript @types/node @types/express ts-node npx tsc --init

Run "npm start" Once you are in the correct directory, run the following command to start your Node.js server:

bash: npm start

This command should run your index.ts file, which starts your Express server and listens on port 3000.

Now we can run the frontend in visual studio
